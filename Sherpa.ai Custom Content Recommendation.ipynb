However, it can be helpful to load multiple entities by using a single command. For instance, that would be the case when migrating an existing database.\n",

We have sampled three of the files from the dataset [Data Science for Good: DonorsChoose.org](https://www.kaggle.com/donorschoose/io), in order to simplify the examples:\n",

    "Interactions | `itemId`, `userId`, `interactionId`, `timestamp` | `value` | The interaction types have to be previously defined. User-item interactions have to be new; updates are not allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Register an Upload Order\n",
    "First, a batch upload order is required for each of the files. The files `Projects.csv`, `Donors.csv` and `Donations.csv`, which are already uploaded on `https://recommender-tutorial-data-set.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/`, contain the data we want to upload. The JSONs returned in the response to these commands include two fields: `requestId` and `status`. The former is the needed to check the order status, which is indicated by the latter.

    "The examples provided are based on two datasets. On the one hand, we will use [Data Science for Good: DonorsChoose.org](https://www.kaggle.com/donorschoose/io), regarding school projects and people that make donations to fund them (in particular, the files `Projects.csv`, `Donors.csv` and `Donations.csv` presented in [Building a Recommender System](#Building-a-Recommender-System)). On the other hand, we will use [MovieLens 100K](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/) and, more specifically, the files `u.item` (for movies), `u.user` (for users), and `u.data` (for ratings given to movies by users). In the following examples, we will assume that the whole of the datasets has been imported into the API. Please, refer to [Building a Recommender System](#Building-a-Recommender-System) and [Loading Massive Data](#Loading-Massive-Data) for step-by-step instructions.\n",
